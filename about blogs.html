           <p>The A-Class Limousine draws inspiration from our childhood dreams and presents a completely new design, one that heralds a new generation of automobiles. The profile is so dynamic yet timelessly elegant.
            Itâ€™s time to take your dreams for a drive in the new A-Class Limousine with Mercedes me connect and MBUX.</p>
            <p>More spacious feeling.
              Formal events, or weekend getaways. Family gatherings, or date night. The all-new A-Class Limousine now lets you do more and be more.
               Never be caught short on space as you keep collecting memories with every escapade in the new A-Class Limousine.</p>
               <p>Knows the way home.
                And your habits.
                MBUX, the new Mercedes-Benz User Experience, introduces artificial intelligence into the A-Class Limousine. It learns more every day and, most importantly of all, gets to know its driver more and more. It can remember your favourite songs and the route to work. It then automatically adjusts the right radio station or 
                shows you a faster way if your usual route is congested. All by itself and as a matter of course, if that is what you want.</p>

            <p>It is not about being better than others. It is about getting better than you are. That is what counts. In sport as well as on the road. The C-Class is known for its perfect proportions,

               <p>On top form, when it matters.
                 The sense of forward momentum in the new C-Class is plain to see the modified front end simply exudes dynamism and contemporary appeal. Depending on
                  the precise specification, it features redesigned bumpers, gleaming chrome trim and stunning new LED headlamps. </p>
                  <p>When it all feels perfect, there can only be one objective.
                   To make it even better.
                   Perfect training conditions await you in the new C-Class: the new steering wheel with Touch Control buttons along with,
                    depending on the precise specification and larger displays including 
                   a new-generation multimedia system, are state-of-the-art features that make operating the car a highly individual affair</p>

            <p>New E, New Attitude.
                The all-new Mercedes-Benz E-Class comes with stunningly elegant exteriors. With contemporary new headlights,

                 E350d comes with an AMG line, diamond grille, AMG bumpers,
                 and sporty side skirts. And finally, the eye-catching 18" AMG alloys complete the all-new E-Class.</p>
                 <p>Intelligence at its best.
                  The reimagined cockpit of the E-Class features a contemporary beige steering wheel and an upgraded front touchpad.
                   With MBUX NTG 6, the E-Class remembers everything; from your favourite routes to responding to your commands. Stay connected to your car from anywhere with Mercedes me connect, which is loaded with features like remote engine start, geofencing, and much more. Sit back and relax with the detachable rear

                  <p>
                    The new E-Class is practically unbeatable in matters of comfort. Air cooling, first-class sound provided by the BurmesterÂ®

                The all-new GLA with its expressive design meets innovative, pioneering technology. On the outside, typical off-road features with

                   of an SUV and a coupÃ© like no other. In a style all of its own. More dynamic and sportier than ever. With wider aprons, new tailpipe trims and, 
                   fitted as standard for the first time, MULTIBEAM LED with sophisticated light design.

                   With its broader shoulders, integrated tailpipe trim and new rim designs, it conveys an even greater sense of power and 
                   dominance. In addition, the new flattened tail lights feature LEDs as standard for the first time. A more striking radiator

                Welcome to the end of the world. The new G-Class is already there. Itâ€™s everywhere.
                 Continuing the tradition of a vehicle built for the most extreme conditions. The G-Class feels different to 
                 the mainstream, particularly in places where other vehicles dare not tread. 
                As if these places were just made for it. Join us on a journey to the holy grail of mobility. Discover the new G-Class.</p>
                  <p>Endless expanses.

                     the vehicle guarantees maximum comfort even in the most uncomfortable environment. The new interior concept turns
                      the G-Glass into a shining example of spaciousness and comfort for all occupants. 
                    The interior design took a quantum leap forward as well. Those who love freedom and unusual design will find both here.</p>
                    <p>Comfortably Exclusive.
                      The G-Class knows no limits. Not even in the interior.
